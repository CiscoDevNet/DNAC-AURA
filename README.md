# DNAC-AURA

The Cisco DNA Center AURA (Audit & Upgrade Readiness) command line tool performs a variety of health, scale & upgrade readiness checks for the DNA Center and the rest of the Fabric network. The tool is extremely simple to run and is executed on the DNA Center. The tool uses API calls, DB reads & show commands (read only operations) and hence, doesn't affect performance or cause impact to the DNA Center or the networking devices.
